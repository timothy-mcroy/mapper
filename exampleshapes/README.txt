The point clouds in this directory are generated from the mesh data at

    http://people.csail.mit.edu/sumner/research/deftransfer/data.html

This web site contains mesh data which was published along with the
following paper:

Robert W. Sumner and Jovan Popović. Deformation Transfer for Triangle Meshes. ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG) – Proceedings of ACM SIGGRAPH 2004,
23(3):399–405, 2004. doi: 10.1145/1015706.1015736.

The data sets published with Python Mapper have been converted: we extracted
the point cloud information (vertices only) from the mesh data. See the web
site above for the original data and for more data sets. For size reasons, only
the "reference" shapes are provided with Python Mapper, not all deformations
available from Sumner and Popović.
