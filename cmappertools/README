Installation
------------

1) Run

    sudo python setup.py install

   or

    python setup.py install --user

2) Or run

    python setup.py build

   and copy the compiled dynamic library file (cmappertools.so on Linux)
   to somewhere in your Python path.


The compiled cmappertools library is imported directly by Python, without
a wrapper.

The library can be compiled for both Python 2.x and 3.x.

Usage
-----

The provided functions are:

kernel_filter::eccentricity

  Eccentricity filter for vector and dissimilarity data; parallel processing

kernel_filter::Gauss_density

  Gaussian density filter for vector and dissimilarity data; parallel
  processing

neighborhood_graph

  This function constructs a neighborhood graph from a compressed distance
  matrix. An edge (v,w) is in the neighborhood graph if one of the following
  holds:

    (1) the distance d(v,w) is not more than epsilon,
    (2) v is among the k nearest neighbors of w,
    (3) w is among the k nearest neighbors of v.

  As everywhere else in Python Mapper, the k nearest neighbors of a point
  start with the point itself, so values k<=1 do not produce any edges, and
  k=2 connects a point to its closest neighbor.

  The edge weight is the distance d(v,w).

  Input: D : a compressed distance matrix
         k : the number of neighbors. Default: 1
         eps : the epsilon from item (1). Default: 0.
         diagonal : Boolean. Whether to include the diagonal (loop edges
                    with zero weight) or not. Default: False
         callback : callback function to report progress. Default: None
         verbose : If True, the functions prints out the minimal epsilon
                   to make the graph connected (without nearest neighbors,
                   ie for k=1). Default: True

  Output: Three NumPy arrays "rowstart", "targets", "weights", which comprise
          the data structure for a weighted, bidirectional CSR graph. See
          the class csr_graph_generator in the source code for details.

ncomp

  Number of components of a graph.

  Input: rowstart, targets : CSR graph
         weights (optional) : ignored
  Output: number of components

graph_distance

  Shortest path metric on a graph. The C++ function takes the NumPy arrays as
  being output by "neighborhood_graph". Parallel processing.

  Input: rowstart, targets, weights : CSR representation of the graph. See the
                                      class csr_graph_generator in the source
                                       code for details.
         callback : callback function to report progress. Default: None

  Output: Compressed distance matrix. If the graph is disconnected, some
          of the distances are infinite.

_conn_comp_loop

  Incrementally find the number of connected components of a graph.

nearest_neighbors_from_dm

  Input:  D compressed distance matrix
          k number of nearest neighbors
          callback : callback function to report progress. Default: None

  Output: d, j distances and indices to the nearest neighbors

compressed_submatrix

  Extract from a compressed distance matrix the corresponding matrix for
  a subset of points without bringing the matrix into square form first.

  Input: dm  compressed distance matrix, of type
             numpy.ndarray(N*(N-1)/2, dtype=float)
         idx indices of the subset, numpy.ndarray(n, dtype=int)

  Output: compressed distance matrix. numpy.ndarray(n*(n-1)/2, dtype=float)

fcluster

  Generate cluster assignments from a dendrogram. The parameter num_clust
  specifies the exact number of clusters. (The method in SciPy does not
  always produce the exact number of clusters, if several heights in the
  dendrogram are equal, or if singleton clustering is requested.)

  This method starts labeling clusters at 0 while the SciPy indices
  are 1-based.

  Input: Z          dendrogram
         num_clust  the number of clusters
